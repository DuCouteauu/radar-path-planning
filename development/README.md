The purpose of the devlopment directory is to design and test solutions completely idependently of the main project

The test_data folder contains various datasets and some instructions on how to use them

Standalone python scripts are also included in this directory and are intended to speed up the design process (eg. the display_grid.py file can be used to display two occupancy grids, one before the flood fill, and one after the flood fill)

Once a feature is complete and produces the expected results for the given test data, it can be integrated into the src directory (the main project)
